Hello and Welcome to my "DeltaStudios Web-Development Personal Project"! or DWPP(?) for short.

'So, what is this DeltaStudios?' you may, or may not, be asking?

If not thats fine too, I'm gonna tell you anyway:

Delta Studios is a sub-section of Delta Productions (Formerly DeltaTech Productions), a Project that I - Salum Ali Muhammed - started as part of a Student Enterprise Awards Project that I previously produced with a couple of Secondary School classmates of mine. 

Because I can, this website project also serves as a Portfolio. Inside said Portfolio, there will be information on things like; information about myself, my CV (at some point), projects past present and future, a newsfeed (of yet-to-be-determined sort), etc.

And in case you're wondering: yes, I decided to draw from the website blurb section for the above README.
